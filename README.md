# Hi, I'm Aaron 👋

I'm a delivery focussed engineer 👨‍💻 who has been architecting, building and shipping enterprise software since 2014. Over the years, I've found my true passion in building efficient teams and highly scalable technical solutions.

**What I'm doing at the minute:**
- 🔭 Developing and shipping solutions at [Econify](https://github.com/Econify)
- 🌱 Finding ways to make TV apps better in my spare time
- 🌥️ Organising the [AWS Birmingham User Group](https://www.meetup.com/AWS-User-Group-West-Midlands/)

💬 Ask me about cloud architecture, NodeJS and building teams.
